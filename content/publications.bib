  abstract={We establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for a class of non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by multiplicative Lévy noise. The equations under consideration model turbulent fluid flow and heat transport in random media. By employing a Galerkin approximation scheme combined with a compact embedding theorem, we prove the convergence of the approximate solutions in appropriate Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we derive a priori estimates that ensure the global regularity of the solution almost surely. A key contribution of this work is the treatment of non-Lipschitz coefficients using a stochastic Gronwall inequality, extending the applicability of the theory to more singular physical models. We also discuss the ergodic properties of the invariant measures associated with the SPDEs.},

  abstract = {Simulating the dynamics of many-body localized (MBL) systems poses a significant challenge due to the logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy. This paper analyzes the algorithmic complexity of contracting Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), when applied to MBL Hamiltonians. We prove that while the exact contraction is #P-complete, approximate contraction schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation exhibit polynomial time complexity with bounded error for short-time evolution. However, we identify a "complexity phase transition" at the ergodic-MBL transition point, where the bond dimension required for a fixed accuracy diverges exponentially. We propose a novel adaptive bond-dimension algorithm that optimizes computational resources by exploiting the area law of entanglement in the localized phase, demonstrating superior performance on Heisenberg spin chains.},
